# I2C-Master-Controller
Designed an RTL-level I2C Master Controller using a finite state machine (FSM) to control SDA/SCL line transitions. Developed a Verilog testbench for stimulus generation and validated protocol behavior using GTKWave. Analyzed waveform outputs (i2c.vcd, sim.out) to verify correct I2C timing and communication.
